#Ubuntu updates can break the graphics drivers after the reboot, check remotely with:
nvidia-smi

#If nothing is detected; users won’t be able to login at the workstation; only remote login works! If that happens, login remotely and re-install the nvidia drivers
cd nvidia
sudo ./install_nvidia_drivers.sh

#Hercules (bay3, window) is especially weird in terms of nividia drivers. Usually it won’t let you re-install the driver due to some background process running. You will get an error message during re-installation. To fix this, check the log file of the installation process:
cat /var/log/nvidia-installer.log

#Find the process number noted in the log file preventing the reinstallation and kill the process with:
sudo kill -9 <process number>

#redo the usual re-installation; should work now.
